## ðŸš€ What is KISS?

KISS stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid"â€”a reminder that simple fixes are usually the best. This thought makes me take big ideas and turn them into clear, tight .NET libraries that just work. Each one is made to be easy to use, easy to get, and easy to add to your own work.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Fluent SQL Builder:**  
  Build SQL queries in C# with a fluent, readable API. No more messy string concatenation!

- **Guard Clauses:**  
  Quickly check your method inputs and catch problems early, so your code stays safe and predictable.

- **Redis Caching:**  
  Add fast, reliable caching to your app with simple Redis helpers.

- **Fluent Email:**  
  Send emails from your app using a clean, provider-agnostic APIâ€”works with SMTP, SendGrid, and more.

- **OpenTelemetry Logger:**  
  Add powerful logging and tracing with almost no setup, so you always know whatâ€™s happening in your app.

- **Quartz Job Scheduler:**  
  Schedule background jobs and recurring tasks with Quartz.NET, made easy.

- **Miscellaneous Helpers:**  
  Handy utilities for those little tasks that pop up everywhere.

If youâ€™re like me and want to spend less time on boilerplate and more time building awesome things, I hope KISS helps you out!

**Letâ€™s keep things simple, and build something great together!**
